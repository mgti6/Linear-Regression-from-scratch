# 🧠 Linear Regression from Scratch — A Comparative Approach

📌 Description
This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Gradient Descent and compares the results with Scikit-learn's LinearRegression and SGDRegressor.
It aims to demonstrate how linear regression works under the hood, how gradient descent optimizes parameters, and how it compares to modern machine learning libraries.

📊 What This Project Covers
💡 Understanding the concept of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a cost function
⛰️ Implementing Gradient Descent with the mountain analogy
📈 Visualizing the fitted line on synthetic data
🔍 Comparing custom implementation with:
LinearRegression (closed-form)
SGDRegressor (gradient descent)
📉 Evaluating and comparing loss (MSE) between models
