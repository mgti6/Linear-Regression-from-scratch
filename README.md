# ðŸ§  Linear Regression from Scratch â€” A Comparative Approach

ðŸ“Œ Description
This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Gradient Descent and compares the results with Scikit-learn's LinearRegression and SGDRegressor.
It aims to demonstrate how linear regression works under the hood, how gradient descent optimizes parameters, and how it compares to modern machine learning libraries.
